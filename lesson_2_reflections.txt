How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
    I can add all those files that need to be part of one commit to the staging area 
    and then commit only those changes
    Afterwards I can add all changes that need to be part of the next commit to the staging area and then commit only those changes
    and so on
    


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
    When you want to fix a bug while you are developing a large feature simultaneously.

    organize work in multiple branches

    work on a new feature in a separate feature branch 
    Merge it to master once it reaches production quality.
